    1) Implemented a modal for UI. Click  "Set Configuration" button to display 2D simulation.
    2) Created a mysql database. So far, i've only included 2 parameters, number of Aliens and Cowboys (can easily be changed later when more parameters are included). 
    To install mysql:
      a) brew install MYSQL
      b) mysql.server start
      c) mysql -uroot
      d) to stop server, "exit" + "mysql.server stop"
